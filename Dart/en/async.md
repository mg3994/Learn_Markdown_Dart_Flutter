# Asynchronous Programming in Dart

Asynchronous operations let your program complete work while waiting for another operation to finish. Here are some basics of asynchronous programming in Dart:

1. **Future**: Dart uses `Future` objects to represent asynchronous operations. A `Future` is a way to look at the values or errors that a function hasn't returned yet.

    ```
    Future<void> fetchUserOrder() {
      // Imagine that this function is fetching user info from another service or database
      return Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3), () => print('Large Latte'));
    }
    ```

2. **async and await**: The `async` and `await` keywords provide a declarative way to define asynchronous functions and use their results.

    ```
    Future<void> fetchUserOrder() async {
      var order = await takeOrder();
      print('Your order is: $order');
    }
    ```

3. **Stream**: A `Stream` provides a way to receive a sequence of events. Each event is either a data event, also called an element of the stream, or an error event, which is a notification that something has failed.

    ```
    Stream<int> countStream(int to) async* {
      for (int i = 1; i <= to; i++) {
        yield i;
      }
    }
    ```

Remember, proper error handling is an important part of writing asynchronous code.
